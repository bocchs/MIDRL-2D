landmark coordinates:
(column, row, slice_num)

(x,y,z)
x = 0 on left side of image, increases from left to right
y = 0 at top of image, increases from top to bottom
z = 0 at lowest (axial) slice, increases in upward direction

Each row in landmarks file corresponds to a specific landmark.
Train the model on the desired landmark by indexing the corresponding row
in sample_circular() in dataReader.py. (e.g. landmark = all_landmarks[14] is for
the pc landmark)
